# AsterixDB Features#

AsterixDB is a BDMS (Big Data Management System) with a rich feature set that
sets it apart from other Big Data platforms.
Its feature set makes it well-suited to modern needs such as web data
warehousing and social data storage and analysis. AsterixDB has:

 * A semistructured NoSQL style data model (ADM) resulting from extending JSON
   with object database ideas
 * An expressive and declarative query language (AQL) that supports a broad
   range of queries and analysis over semistructured data
 * A parallel runtime query execution engine, Hyracks, that has been
   scale-tested on up to 1000+ cores and 500+ disks
 * Partitioned LSM-based data storage and indexing to support efficient
   ingestion and management of semistructured data
 * Support for query access to externally stored data (e.g., data in HDFS) as
   well as to data stored natively by AsterixDB
 * A rich set of primitive data types, including spatial and temporal data in
   addition to integer, floating point, and textual data
 * Secondary indexing options that include B+ trees, R trees, and inverted
   keyword (exact and fuzzy) index types
 * Support for fuzzy and spatial queries as well as for more traditional
   parametric queries
 * Basic transactional (concurrency and recovery) capabilities akin to those of
   a NoSQL store

### Disclaimer ###
Apache AsterixDB is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache incubator.
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.
While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.
